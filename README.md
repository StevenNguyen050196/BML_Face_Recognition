## Our best version: face_recognition_v4
* We created file .pikle to save embedding features of images. If you have new datasets, you can add it in folder "face_recognition\dataset", then run command lines to create new file embedding.
```
# python
cd face_recognition_v4\src
python FaceEmbedding.py
```  


## Feel excited to experience my UI demo
```
# python
cd face_recognition_v4\gui
python app-gui.py
